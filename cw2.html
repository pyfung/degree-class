<h2>The Problem</h2>

You are going to implement a degree classification
calculator for our BSc and MSc degrees.
(Sorry to students on MComp or other degrees. You are welcome to add more
subclasses to the program yourself of course...)

<h3>Student cohorts and the class hierarchy</h3>

<p>
As you know, BSc and MSc degrees are awarded to different classes, such as 
first class, upper second class, etc for BSc, and Distinction, Merit, etc 
for MSc. The classification is made according to a set of rules, based on the 
marks profile of a student. Each of BSc and MSc have their own set of degree
classification rules. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, a few years ago, the university revised and phased in a new 
set of degree classification rules for BSc degrees. As a result,
two cohorts of BSc students that are governed by different rules will be 
graduating at the same time this year. (And this will be the first and only
year when a substantial number of new and old students graduate together.)
</p>
<p>
Roughly speaking, BSc students entering as first years in 2018/19
are "new" students, governed by new rules in place
for the first time this year. Students entering in 2017/18 or earlier, 
but only reaching the third year now for various reasons such as
spending a year in industry, are "old" students governed by
the old rules. 
</p>
<p>
This naturally gives us a hierarchy of students, as represented in this 
diagram. 
The following classes and the class hierarchy are declared for you in
the given Student.h file.
</p>
<pre>
                 Student
                    |
            -------------------
            |                 |
        BScStudent         MScStudent
            |
      --------------
      |             |
BScStudentOld  BScStudentNew
</pre>

<h3>Modules, credits and marks</h3>

<p>
Each module has a module code, which is a 6-character string like "CO3105". 
The third character in this string (3 in this case) indicates which year the 
module is for: 2 is for BSc Year 2, 3 is for BSc Year 3, 7 is for MSc.
(From now on we will abbreviate "Year 2" and "Year 3" to Y2 and Y3.)
</p>
<p>
Each module has a fixed number of credits. Each BSc student is supposed to 
take modules worth a total of 120 credits in each of Y2 and Y3,
and each MSc student is supposed to take 180 credits for the whole year,
including a 60-credit project.
</p>
<p>
To avoid you (and me) repeatedly having to type in the number of credits
of each module, this information is contained in a data structure called
MCT (short for Module-Credit-Table), defined in
the file Module.h. It includes all common modules that you will encounter,
as well as three "fake" modules (ending with FAK) for easier testing.
The data structure is a "map" from STL which we will only cover one week
before the deadline. Hence we included below all you need to know about it:
it can be used like
<pre>
string moduleCode = ...;
if(MCT.find(moduleCode) == MCT.end()) { 
  // if true, this means no module with that moduleCode is in MCT
}
// else it is in MCT

int credits = MCT.at(moduleCode);
// this returns the number of credits of this module, as stored in MCT.
// if no module with that code exists in the MCT it will throw an exception
</pre>
</p>
<p>
All marks and averages are numbers of the <code>float</code> data type. 
You can assume (do not need to check) that the marks are between 0.0 and 100.0 
(inclusive).
</p>

<h3>The degree classification rules</h3>

Your actual degree classification rules are extremely complicated and are
described in <a href="rules.html">a separate page</a>.

<h3>Supported operations</h3>

The various student classes should support the following operations:

<ul>
<li>
A constructor that takes the uid (a string) of the student as input.
</li>
<li>
<code>bool addModule(string moduleCode, float mark)</code>: 
add the module with the given module code and mark to the student.
If the module code does not exist (is not one of the given ones in Module.h),
or if it is not for the correct year group for the student (e.g. adding a
level 7 module to a BSc Student),
or if it is already added, 
or if adding this exceeds the total credit for the relevant year of the 
degree, return false and do not add the module.
Otherwise, return true.
</li>
<li>
<code>bool updateMark(string moduleCode, float mark)</code>: 
update the module mark
with that module code for this student with the given mark.
The module should have been added to this student previously;
if no such module code has been added to the student before, 
or if the module code does not exist,
return false and do not change anything.
Otherwise, return true.
</li>
<li>
<code>float y2cwa()</code>: return the Year 2 credit-weighted average of the student,
based on the modules added so far. In other words, if less than 120 credits
of modules have been added, it should still calculate an average based
on those modules added. If no modules have been added so far, return 0.
This function only applies to <code>BScStudent</code> (and its subclasses).
</li>
<li>
<code>float y3cwa()</code>: same as above except this is for Year 3.
</li>
<li>
<code>float cwa()</code>: return the overall credit-weighted average, based on
all modules added so far.
For <code>BScStudent</code> this is a combined average of the Y2 and Y3 CWA
(according to specific rules for <code>BScStudentOld</code> or 
<code>BScStudentNew</code>). For <code>MScStudent</code> this is simply
the credit-weighted average of all modules.
Again, if no modules have been added so far, return 0.
</li>
<!--
<li>
<code>void setY1FailedCredits(int credits)</code>: sets the amount of failed
credits in Year 1 to the given value. This applies only to 
<code>BScStudentNew</code>. If this function was never called, the amount
of Y1 failed credits should be assumed to be 0.
</li>
-->
<li>
<code>string calcDegClass()</code>: return a string containing the calculated 
degree class. It should be one of: 
<ul>
For BSc: "FIRST CLASS", "BORDERLINE FIRST CLASS", "UPPER SECOND CLASS",
"BORDERLINE UPPER SECOND CLASS", "LOWER SECOND CLASS", 
"BORDERLINE LOWER SECOND CLASS", "THIRD CLASS", "PASS", and "FAIL".
</ul><ul>
For MSc: "DISTINCTION", "MERIT", "PASS", and "FAIL".
</ul>
The full amount of credits must be entered before degree classification
rules can be applied.
If insufficient credits are entered, it should return the string
"INSUFFICIENT CREDITS".
</li>
</ul>
In addition, there are two overloaded stream operators.
They are to be implemented as friend functions (not as member functions
of any class):
<ul>
<li>
<code>istream& operator>>(istream& is, Student& student)</code>:
the overloaded >> operator that reads module and mark information from
the input stream to the student object.
Each line in the stream consists of a string (the module code) and a float
(the mark of the module), separated by a space. 
Each such module read in should be added to this student, according to
all the conditions in <code>addModule()</code>. In cases where
<code>addModule()</code> would have returned false, you don't need to
return any kind of error information here; 
just ignore that module and quietly move on to the next one.
You should read until the end of the stream.
You can assume the stream data will conform to the above specification,
so no input error handling is needed.
</li>
<li>
<code>ostream& operator&lt;&lt;(ostream& os, const Student& student)</code>:
output the following to the output stream: the student's uid, followed
by a tab character ('\t'), following by the degree classification as 
returned by <code>calcDegClass()</code>. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Further details of what exactly each function should do is in the 
Student.h and various [BSc|MSc]Student[Old|New].cpp
files.
(We defined all classes in a single header file, but each class has its
own .cpp file.)
</p>
<p>
In all calculations, you can ignore the issue of floating point inacuracy.
For example, comparisons with &gt;, &gt;= etc. can be applied directly like
<code>if (cwa() >= 69.5)</code> ...
</p>

<h3>What can be / need to be changed</h3>

<p>
The classes <code>Student</code>, <code>BScStudent</code>, 
<code>BScStudentNew</code>, <code>BScStudentOld</code>, and 
<code>MScStudent</code>, as well as their
inheritance relationships, have been defined for you.
However, all the required member functions are only declared in the
highest class in the class hierarchy where they are relevant.
You will need to decide whether some subclasses should override some
of the functions, where in the hierarchy should they be implemented, and 
whether each function should be made virtual.
<!--
and possibly add/move/remove some member functions to some lower classes.
-->
</p>
<p>
In addition, all non-leaf classes should be abstract; only instances of 
<code>BScStudentNew</code>, <code>BScStudentOld</code> and 
<code>MScStudent</code> should be allowed to be created.
This means each non-leaf class must have some pure virtual member functions,
so you will need to decide where to use the 
<code>= 0</code> pure specifier.
</p>
<p>
You must not change the existing public interface of the class, other than 
in relation to inheritance, virtual-ness and pure-ness as explained above.
You are allowed to add public/protected/private member functions, 
should you want to.
</p>
<p>
You will also need to decide what protected/private data members to add to
some of the classes.
You can either use basic data types such as arrays, or STL containers if
you wish. If you need to, you can assume some maximum limit on the number
of modules a student may take (such as the constant MAX_MODULES defined
in Student.h; you can remove these constants if you don't need them).
</p>
<!--
The classes, as defined, did not include any inheritance relationships.
You must implement their relationships as indicated.

<h2>Files Provided</h2>

<!--
For your convenience <a href="cw2.zip">this</a> is a zip file that contains 
all the files described below.
-->

<ul>
<li><a href="Student.h">Student.h</a></li>
<li><a href="Student.cpp">Student.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="BScStudent.cpp">BScStudent.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="BScStudentOld.cpp">BScStudentOld.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="BScStudentNew.cpp">BScStudentNew.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="MScStudent.cpp">MScStudent.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
These are the only files you need to modify/submit. All code written
by you should be in there.
<ul>
<li><a href="Module.h">Module.h</a></li>
</ul>
The file that contains the module credit info. You need this file to
compile the programs. You should not modify this file.
<ul>
<li><a href="main.cpp">main.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
This is just an example that illustrates how the 
functions can be called.
<ul>
<li><a href="StudentTester.h">StudentTester.h</a></li>
<li><a href="StudentTester.cpp">StudentTester.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="StudentTesterMain.cpp">StudentTesterMain.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="teststudent1.txt">teststudent1.txt</a></li>
<li><a href="teststudent2.txt">teststudent2.txt</a></li>
<li><a href="teststudent3.txt">teststudent3.txt</a></li>
</ul>
They are used for the execution testing part (see the next section).
The three txt files are needed for some of the test cases.
<ul>
<li><a href="makefile">makefile</a></li>
</ul>
This is a makefile that will compile the main executable and the testing
suite executable.

<h2>Marking Criteria and Test Suites</h2>

<p>
See <a href="ms.html">this separate page</a> for the marking criteria.
</p>
<p>
To use the test suite (which is used in the execution testing part of the 
marking), simply type &quot;make&quot; in a linux terminal (with all 
the above files in the same folder). It will (assuming you did not break
the given .h and .cpp files) produce a StudentTesterMain executable file. Run the 
program by typing
</p><pre>
./StudentTesterMain a
</pre>
or
<pre>
./StudentTesterMain a b c d
</pre>
which runs a single test case or multiple test cases respectively. 
We will also demonstrate its use in class. 
<p>
</p><p>
The test suite may not cover all corner cases, so passing all test
cases does not guarantee your program is 100% correct.
Also, unfortunately we cannot isolate the testing of the various functions.
For example to pass those test cases meant for <code>cwa()</code> you 
need to also implement <code>addModule()</code> at least partially correctly.
</p>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

<p>
Submit your completed work on Blackboard (&quot;Assessment and Feedback&quot; on the 
left, then &quot;Assignment 2&quot;).
</p>
<p>
Submit <b>only</b> the files Student.h, Student.cpp, BScStudent.cpp,
BScStudentOld.cpp, BScStudentNew.cpp and MScStudent.cpp.
Just upload them as separate files (contrary to earlier version of this page,
DO NOT zip them).
Please note the linux file system is case-sensitive.
DO NOT change the upper/lowercase of filenames.
If you do, it will not work with the makefile/test suite and a penalty will
be applied.
</p>
<p>
Optionally, if you want to change the makefile (for example to use C++17)
you can submit a revised makefile. Otherwise I will use the one I supplied.
Your revised makefile must still work on the departmental linux system.
In particular it has g++ version 9.3.0, which by default uses C++14 but
it supports "most" of C++17 and you can change the compiler flag to tell
it to use that.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Upload one zip archive containing all of these files <b>at the top level</b>
(i.e. no subdirectories).
Your zip file <b>MUST</b> be called cw2.zip (lowercase).
</p>
-->
<p>
Do not upload the entire project folder of whatever IDE you are using.
While you may want to change the main.cpp file for your own testing, 
it is not part of the submission. The test suites also
should not be submitted. If you submit them, they will be ignored and I
will use my own version for testing.
</p>
