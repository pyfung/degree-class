<h1>CO3105/4203/7105 Assignment 2: Degree Classification Rules</h1>

<p>
<b>Disclaimer</b>: the description below may or may not be exactly identical
to the degree classification rules as stated by the university.
The official rules can be found in the Senate Regulations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
BScStudentOld:
<a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/sas2/regulations/documents/sr5-july-2018">
https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/sas2/regulations/documents/sr5-july-2018</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
In particular, some simplifications are made that does not affect the 
overwhelming majority of cases, but there could be odd situations where
there is a difference. Some others used hidden assumptions (like credits are
always multiples of 15 in BScNew). 
Finally, my interpretation of the rules may not be correct!
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of this assignment, what is described below (and any 
subsequent clarification made by me) is the ultimate source of information.
But for the actual degree classification you obtain in the end, the 
university's decision is final.
Please do not complain to me and/or the university if the two give different
results.
</p>
<p>
Also, the following description does not take into account any "exceptional
variations" made to the rules due to Covid-19.
<!--(Trust me, they are complicated enough without them.)-->
</p>
<p>
<b>A note about numerical accuracy.</b>
In real life, your marks and averages are supposed to be in 2 decimal places,
but different rounding conventions apply depending on different versions
of the rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For BScStudentOld and MScStudent, marks are recorded to 2 decimal places but 
implicitly rounded to integers when comparing against mark thresholds in 
degree classification rules.
</li>
<li>
For BScStudentNew, 2 decimal places are actually used.
</li>
<!--<li>
For MScStudent, marks are actually rounded to integers, and averages are
implicitly rounded when comparing against thresholds as in BScStudentOld.
</li>-->
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For everyone's sanity (and maybe one day the university will come to its 
senses), instead of managing them separately, we will just assume
in this assignment that everything is of the <code>float</code> data type.
Furthermore we adjusted the degree classification rules
for BScStudentOld and MScStudent to include an offset of 0.5 from the 
officially stated ones for all mark thresholds.
</p>

<!-- Don't worry, we will revisit this in your Assignment 3! -->

<h2>All BSc Students</h2>

<p>
Students take a total of 120 credits of modules in each of year 2 and 3.
First you need to calculate the credit weighted average (CWA) for each year,
given by this formula:
</p>
<pre>
                sum (credit of module i * mark of module i)
CWA of a year = -------------------------------------------
                       sum (credit of module i)
</pre>
<p>
where the sums are over all modules of that year.
For example, if there is a 60-credit module of mark 66.6, a 40-credit module
of mark 44.4 and a 20-credit module of mark 22.2, the CWA is
(60*66.6 + 40*44.4 + 20*22.2)/120 = 51.8.
</p>
<p>
Then there is an overall CWA (OCWA), based on the Y2 and Y3 CWA (to be 
described below).
</p>
<!--<p>
Y1 marks have no significance (other than to get you to Y3!)
</p>-->

<h3>BScStudentsOld</h3>

<p>
First, calculate the OCWA,
by mixing the Y2 CWA and Y3 CWA in the ratio 2:3. That is,
OCWA = 0.4 * Y2CWA + 0.6 * Y3CWA.
</p>
<p>
Then, determine whether each Y2 and Y3 module is a pass or fail. 
A module is a pass if (i) its mark is at least 39.50; or
(ii) its mark is at least 34.50 and the CWA <b>of that year</b> is at least
39.50. Otherwise it is a fail.
Count the number of credits of failed (Y2 and Y3) modules.
</p>
<p>
Then you need to count the number of credits (in Y2 and Y3) where the 
module mark falls into each of the bands in the table below. For example
"credits at 69.5+ >= 120" means you require 120 or more credits of modules
with marks at or above 69.5.
</p>
<p>
With all this, finally the degree classification can be decided
by applying the following rules in descending order:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>Condition</th>
</tt>
<tr>
<td>Fail</td>
<td>OCWA < 34.5 OR failed credits >= 50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 69.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 66.5 AND credits at 69.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits < 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borderline first class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 66.5 AND credits at 69.5+ >= 90 AND credits at 67.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits < 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 66.5 AND credits at 69.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits >= 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 59.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 56.5 AND credits at 59.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits < 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borderline upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 56.5 AND credits at 59.5+ >= 90 AND credits at 57.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits < 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 56.5 AND credits at 59.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits >= 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 49.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 46.5 AND credits at 49.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits < 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borderline lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 46.5 AND credits at 49.5+ >= 90 AND credits at 47.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits < 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 46.5 AND credits at 49.5+ >= 120 AND failed credits >= 40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 39.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pass</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 34.5</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>BScStudentNew</h3>

<p>
First, calculate the OCWA,
by mixing the Y2 CWA and Y3 CWA in the ratio 33:67, that is
OCWA = 0.33 * Y2CWA + 0.67 * Y3CWA.
</p>
<p>
Then, determine the total number of credits of failed Y2 or Y3 modules. 
A module is a pass if its mark is at least 40.00, otherwise it is a fail. 
<!--All Y1, Y2 and Y3 modules are counted. -->
<!--Since Y1 module marks are not otherwise used,
for Y1 the actual module marks are not given here and only the number of 
failed credits is supplied (by the <code>setY1FailedCredits()</code> member
function.)-->
</p>
<p>
Then, you need to count the number of credits (in Y2 and Y3) where the 
module mark falls into each of the bands in the table below. Note that some
are specific to Y3, e.g.
"Y3 credits at 70+ >= 30" means you require 30 or more credits of Y3 modules
with marks at or above 70.00.
</p>
<p>
With all this, finally the degree classification can be decided
by applying the following rules in descending order:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>Condition</th>
</tt>
<tr>
<td>Fail</td>
<td>OCWA < 35.00 OR failed credits > 45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 70.00 AND failed credits <= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 68.00 AND credits at 70+ >= 120 AND Y3 credits at 70+ >= 30
AND failed credits <= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borderline first class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 68.00 AND credits at 70+ >= 90 AND credits at 68+ >= 120
AND Y3 credits at 70+ >= 30 AND failed credits <= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 60.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 58.00 AND credits at 60+ >= 120 AND Y3 credits at 60+ >= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borderline upper second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 58.00 AND credits at 60+ >= 90 AND credits at 58+ >= 120
AND Y3 credits at 60+ >= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 50.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 48.00 AND credits at 50+ >= 120 AND Y3 credits at 50+ >= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borderline lower second class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 48.00 AND credits at 50+ >= 90 AND credits at 48+ >= 120
AND Y3 credits at 50+ >= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 40.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third class</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 38.00 AND credits at 40+ >= 120 AND Y3 credits at 40+ >= 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pass</td>
<td>OCWA &gt;= 35.00</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>MSc Students</h2>

<p>
Students take a total of 180 credits of modules in the year, including
a 60-credit project. The other 120 credits are referred to as the
"taught part".
</p>
<p>
First you need to calculate the overall credit weighted average (OCWA),
using the same formula as in the BScStudent section but over all 180
credits.
</p>
<p>
Next, you need to count the number of credits at each of the bands below.
In addition to the "credits at 69.5+" type of bands (see BScStudentOld),
there is a "narrow fail" which means a mark greater than or equal to 39.5 but
less than 49.5, and "bad fail" which means a mark below 39.5.
Then the degree classification is made according to:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Outcome</th>
<th>Condition</th>
</tt>
<tr>
<td>Distinction</td>
<td>(OWCA >= 69.5 OR taught part credits at 69.5+ >= 60)
AND project mark >= 69.5 AND narrow or bad fail credits == 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merit</td>
<td>(OWCA >= 59.5 OR taught part credits at 59.5+ >= 60)
AND project mark >= 59.5 AND narrow fail credits <= 15 AND
bad fail credits == 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pass</td>
<td>(OWCA >= 49.5 OR taught part credits at 49.5+ >= 90)
AND project mark >= 49.5 AND narrow fail credits <= 30 AND
bad fail credits == 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fail</td>
<td>All other cases</td>
</tr>
</table>
